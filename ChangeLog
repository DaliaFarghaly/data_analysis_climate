## [safi] 2018-11-05
### Implemented
	- Implement hotCold function to draw a distribution of hottest and coldest day in Lund since 1961.
	- Fit the distribution of hottest day using Gaussian distribution.

## [safi] 2018-11-09
## Implemented
   - tempPerMonth: this function can calculate the (mean, max, min) temperature each month. On other word, it calculates the average, hottest, coldest day of each month.

##[Philip] 2018-11-09
## Implemented
   - DayTemp: This function will take two parameters, monthToCalculate and dayToCalculate, and will put all the measured temperatures
   on that day every year since 1961 in a histogram and show the histogram. If there are multiple readins on a given day, the readings
   are averaged with no weight.
