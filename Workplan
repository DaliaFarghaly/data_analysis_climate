This the Workplan for group F.

# Starting a project on GitHub:
## Example Function assigned:
   - Philip: tempOnDay, the first one.
   - Safi: hotCold. (Done)
   - Dalia: tempPerYear.
   - Taichi: tempPerDay
## Choosing a new function:
   - tempPerMonth: this function can calculate the (mean, max, min) temperature each month. On other word, it calculates the average, hottest, coldest day of each month.
